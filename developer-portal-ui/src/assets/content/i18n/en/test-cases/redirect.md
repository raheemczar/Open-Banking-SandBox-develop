# Short overview of REDIRECT approach:

- The whole SCA process with two different factors (e.g. username/password as proof of knowledge and a one time password (TAN) as proof of possession) is provided by the ASPSP and executed directly between PSU and ASPSP.
- Therefore, the PSU needs to gets redirected from PISP to ASPSP.
- The SCA of the PSU is executed directly between the ASPSP and the PSU.
- After completion of the SCA the PSU gets redirected back to the PISP.
