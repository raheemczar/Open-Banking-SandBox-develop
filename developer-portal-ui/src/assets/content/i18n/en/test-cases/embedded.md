# Short overview of EMBEDDED approach:

- The whole SCA process with two different factors (e.g. username/password as proof of knowledge and a one time password (TAN) as proof of possession) is provided by the TPP and executed not directly between PSU and ASPSP, but with TPPs calls to XS2A Interface.
- TPP uses predefined XS2A endpoints to complete authorisation flow.
